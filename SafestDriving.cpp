//  Safest Driving Area
//Write a program that  determines  which of five geographic  regions within  a major  city (north, south,  east, west, and  central)  had  the fewest reported automobile accidents last year. It should have the following two functions,  which are called by main.
//
//*     int getNumAccidents() is passed the name of a region. It asks the user for the number  of automobile accidents reported in that  region during  the last year, vali- dates the input,  then returns  it. It should be called once for each city region.
//*     void findLowest() is passed the five accident  totals.  It determines  which is the smallest and prints the name of the region, along with its accident figure.
//Input  Validation: Do not accept an accident number  that is less than 0.
//  Doesn't work!!!
